# Glowbat
A 2D exploration arcade game where players control a bat navigating through dark, expansive cave systems. The primary objective is to keep the cave illuminated by eating fireflies. The cave darkens as the light gradually dims, creating tension between exploration and light management. The game ends if the bat collides with obstacles or if darkness engulfs the screen.
